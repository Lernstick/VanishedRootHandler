Description: Handles a vanished root file system when running a live system
 When the root file system on a live system vanishes, e.g. because the
 connection between a USB stick and the computer got lost, we have to notify
 the user about this fact and reboot or shutdown the system.
 The problem is that when the root file system is gone we usually can't even
 start the program to show the error message. Therefore we use memlockd to lock
 all the files we need for showing the error message and shutting down or
 rebooting into memory.
 If it becomes possible in the future to recover from a vanished root file
 system this program should just display a warning and request for re-insertion
 of the disconnected USB stick instead of an error and shutdown/reboot.
