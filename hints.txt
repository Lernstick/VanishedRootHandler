system calls that matter for file access:

access  : checks, if the user can access the file
stat    : returns the file attributes
open    : gets a file descriptor
readlink: reads a symbolic link
execve  : executes a file

also add vanished_root_handler binary to memlock config!
some paths have ".." in them, fix them!

keep only files in the strace file:
for i in $(cat strace.txt) ; do if [ -f $i ]; then echo $i; fi; done > strace.txt.filesonly

add resolved symlinks:
for i in $(cat strace.txt.filesonly); do echo $i; if [ -L $i ]; then readlink -f $i; fi; done > strace.txt.resolved

how to log every file access:
-----------------------------
$ sudo apt-get install auditd
$ auditctl -w / -p rwa -k allfiles

then you filter the entries from /var/log/audit/audit.log
